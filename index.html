				<h1>About Chitose</h1>
				<p>Chitose is aiming to become an SMS LISP compiler. Working with her is simple,
				simply text her a LISP and she would return an output for you. Since she's relatively new, she still
				can't do much. Right now, she can handle simple arithmetic and if-statement. She can also perform
				seq as well. The provided screenshot should tell you what she's currently capable of. She still
				lacks abilities in many areas such as declaring variables or dealing with lists.</p>
				
				<p>Now, you may think that it's a waste of time by trying to create an SMS LISP compiler.
				If SMS LISP compiling is all Chitose does, then yes, you're right. However, I aim to augment her
				with other abilities such as obtaining weather data. With these new ability, she can become
				a service provider for any geek with a cellphone. The cellphone doesn't even need to be that great,
				it merely needs to be able to send and receive SMS.</p>
				
				<p>You may also be able to involve Chitose in your app as well. For example, you can ask Chitose for
				weather data in your weather app when normal Internet access is unavailable. You just text her
				something - in LISP of course!</p>
				
				<p>I don't know what would actually happen in the future though. Que Sera Sera.</p>

				<h1>What's up with the name, and why it's a she</h1>
				<p>I generally name my software after small cities around the world (Like Microsoft who used to
				name software after large cities in the past). Chitose is a city in Hokkaido, so that's reason
				enough for me to choose.</p>
				
				<p>Chitose is also a Japanese female name. So this app is a she. And by acting as if Chitose is a
				person, I am trying to use psychology to make you feel attached to her somehow.</p>

				<h1>I want to ask Chitose something...</h1>
				<p>Unfortunately, Chitose is still very new, so it's too early for her to be tested. It doesn't help
				either that Chitose is running on Twilio trial number. This means that I would need to verify your
				telephone number before you can ask her anything. She's not a public person right now...</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<h1>Technical stuffs and open sourcing</h1>
				<p>Chitose is a Sinatra rack app. This means that she's written with Ruby. She's hosted on Heroku.
				She's also using Twilio for telephony abilities. Unfortunately, as of now, Chitose is closed-source. 
				Unlike my previous efforts, I am not so generous this time. However, I can tell you that she's just
				a simple S-Syntax parser with an incomplete interpreter.</p>
